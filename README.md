# Tableau base map definitions

This is a collection of base map layers that I've added to my Tableau installation, and they at least worked when I committed them.

To add them to your own Tableau installation, download the files and follow the directions [here](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/maps_mapsources_import.html)

I've tried to add appropriate attribution strings, but if these are your tiles and you're not satisfied with the attribution I've provided, please open an issue for it, or better yet, give me a pull request for the preferred attribution. And thanks for your hard work, tile makers!
